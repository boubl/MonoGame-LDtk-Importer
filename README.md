![LDtk Monogame Importer](/docfx_project/images/logo%20small.png)

This is a MonoGame importer for [Ldtk](https://ldtk.io/) by [Deepnight](https://deepnight.net/).

**This is not a renderer!** It's only a loader.

You can find a [documentation](https://realboubli.github.io/MonoGame-LDtk-Importer) here (not finished yet)
