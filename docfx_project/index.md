# Monogame Custom Importer for LDtk
This is a LDtk project importer only ***(not a renderer)*** for the Monogame Framework.

This documentation is for the importer only, so please check [here for LDtk related stuff](https://ldtk.io/).

Feel free to improve it, it's open source on my [GitHub](https://github.com/chamalowmoelleux/MonoGame-LDtk-Importer).
