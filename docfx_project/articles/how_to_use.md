# How to use

You can load your LDtk project using this line:
```cs
LDtkProject project = Content.Load<LDtkProject>("Name of your file");
```

And that's is, you project is now loaded in your game. It's now up to you to see how to render it.
I'm currently writing an example for the rendering logic and this documentation, so you can refer to the [official LDtk documentation](https://ldtk.io/docs/game-dev/json-overview/) (there is differences between JSON and C# objects only in the name of the properties, but they are organized in the same way) while I'm finishing this up
